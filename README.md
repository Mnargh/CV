Since graduating from university with a master's degree in Biochemistry, I spent some time searching for a career that I really felt I could focus all of my energy and passion on. I found this in programming, and began by setting myself weekly goals to teach myself. Eventually, I decided to pursue more structured help, and was accepted in to Maker's Academy, a selective 16 week software development course based in London.

At Makers, I learned the importance of best coding practices and honed my skills through completing both individual and group projects that would test my ability. I enjoyed every minute of it, and having promptly gotten myself thoroughly addicted, I have discovered that there are just not enough hours in the day to explore all the aspects of programming I want to get involved in! I am now eager to pursue my next challenge as a software developer in a professional environment where I have the opportunity to learn and excel to the best of my ability.

## Skills

#### Logical Thinking

I have a keen mind that relishes the logical problem solving that exemplifies computer programming, and which has earned me a top 150 place in the UK Mathematical Olympiad. I chose Biochemistry at University College London to pursue my curiosity for how living systems operate, survive and die, and because the independent thinking and critical analysis skills required for studying complex biological systems are invaluable and adaptable in a wide range of career paths, including software development.


#### Communication

 A work placement at Baker & McKenzie, allowed me to gain experience in a corporate environment providing services to a number of clients, simultaneously developing my commercial awareness and professional communication skills. Working as a waiter, in tandem with my third year of university, improved my ability to read a customer’s body language and react accordingly. This has proved invaluable in situations where it has been important to understand people and respond to their needs in an appropriate and effective way, such as when interviewing guests on my university radio show and collaborating in group projects while at Maker's Academy.


#### Adaptability

I have a variety of experiences that derive from a broad interest in acquiring new skills. Critical to this has been the ability to "learn to learn" a new skill quickly. Prior to Makers Academy, my experience of programming was limited to building a basic website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to help new students on my university course improve their maths, and  dabbling in rudimentary logic solving programs using C. During the sixteen weeks of the course, I have progressed to being able to build and test whole projects in an array (ha!) of languages and frameworks. This has given me the confidence to, along with a motley crew of other budding developers, create a product in an entirely new full stack (MERN) in just 10 days for my final project.

## Extra Curricular

I have sought after positions that encourage collaboration and leadership throughout my life; I captained the school athletics team and have been elected as treasurer for both the UCL Biochemistry Society and the UCLU Dodgeball Club at university, refining my financial management skills and demonstrating my confidence in taking on new responsibilities. I fulfilled a role as the chairman of the UCLU Dodgeball Club, using my strong networking and management skills to ensure the club’s short and long term strategies are being employed in the correct manner. I have always gravitated towards team sports such as rugby, football and dodgeball, and was instrumental in leading the UCLU Dodgeball 1st team to the league playoffs in two consecutive years.


## Interests
- I have a growing interest in **photography** as a hobby, primarily focused on wildlife, landscape and astrophotography. Living in London has encouraged me to pursue some cityscape and night time shots. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mnarghy/)

- I love **reading** a good fantasy series, and would welcome any and all suggestions! Science fiction is right up there on my list too. Since getting in to programming, there are a host of programming books I have been reading/trying to find the time to read. A personal favourite is Sandi Metz, and I have been enjoying the depth and variety of books and facets to coding and technology there are available!
